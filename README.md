Many other things later, but first and foremost:

•⁠  ⁠Implementation of DID-generation and -registration of app user via provided Email
•⁠  ⁠Implementation of DID-signing via QR-Code of witnessed events by other DID-registered app users as event witnesses
•⁠  ⁠Implementation of device ID as proof of origin of recorded media files
•⁠  ⁠Implementation of an automatic upload of recorded digital media files with DID managed encryption to Filecoin after BC proof on Hydraledger. These original files must be made available on permission by the author to potential interested parties and judges.

Further tasks:

•⁠  ⁠development of an HRecorder API for integration into other recorder apps with millions of users

•⁠  ⁠a temper-proof and reliable locationstamp as companion to the already implemented timestamp on the BC

•⁠  ⁠integration of templates for all types of oral and written contracts, that could need proof via HRecorder

•⁠  ⁠AI integration might be uselful 

•⁠  ⁠integration of a speech-to-text dictaphone

•⁠  ⁠automatic recording of phone calls for BC proof

•⁠  ⁠translations into the main languages of most promising target groups
